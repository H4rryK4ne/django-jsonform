django-jsonform 2.21.0 release notes
====================================


Nov 23, 2023
------------

This is a minor release.


New Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- **Overriding references**

  While using ``$ref``, you can now override the properties set by the reference,
  like setting custom titles for the reference.


Bugfixes
^^^^^^^^

- Earlier, when the schema didn't have a ``type`` at the top level but did have a ``$ref``,
  the form raised an error without considering the ``$ref``. Now, it will infer the type
  from ``$ref`` if ``type`` is not provided.


react-json-form (JavaScript)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`react-json-form <https://github.com/bhch/react-json-form>`_ has been updated
to version 2.13.0.
