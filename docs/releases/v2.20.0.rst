django-jsonform 2.20.0 release notes
====================================


Nov 10, 2023
------------

This release brings some new features and improvements.


New Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- **Constant values**

  Support for the ``const`` keyword. (:ref:`See docs <const>`).

- **Multiselect + Autocomplete**

  Support multiselect autocomplete input using ``"widget": "multiselect-autocomplete"``.

- **Collapsible sections**

  You will now see ``[-]`` and ``[+]`` icons in section titles which can be used
  for collapsing and expanding array or object sections.


Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- :issue:`121`: The form is more tolerant now when it receives ``null`` data for array or object types.
  The form will implicitly replace ``null`` with the appropriate blank data instead of throwing an error.


react-json-form (JavaScript)

`react-json-form <https://github.com/bhch/react-json-form>`_ has been updated
to version 2.12.0.
