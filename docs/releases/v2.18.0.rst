django-jsonform 2.18.0 release notes
====================================


Jul 27, 2023
------------

This is a minor release.


New features
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Support for the ``description`` keyword. This will allow for adding helpful text
  for objects and arrays.


Minor changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- :issue:`115`: Manually added keys (when using ``additionalProperties``) will display
  their key name as it is. Earlier, the name was *prettified* (i.e. capitalized, underscores removed)
  for display purposes, but that will no longer happen.


react-json-form (JavaScript)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`react-json-form <https://github.com/bhch/react-json-form>`_ has been updated
to version 2.9.0.
