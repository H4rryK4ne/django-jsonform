Dec 02, 2023
------------

This is a patch release which fixes an important bug in ``oneOf``/``anyOf`` subschema
matching logic.


Bugfixes
^^^^^^^^

- :issue:`131`: Previously, the form ignored ``oneOf``/``anyOf`` while syncing
  stale data with new schema. This caused the form to crash. This release fixes that.

`react-json-form <https://github.com/bhch/react-json-form>`_ has been updated
to version 2.13.1.
