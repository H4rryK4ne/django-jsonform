Like the previous version, it also supports ``Django >= 2.0`` and ``Python >= 3.4``.


New features

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- :issue:`69`: Allow hyphens in schema object keys.
- :issue:`70`: Made the widget compatible with HTMX.

Breaking changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **Custom validation**

  Due to fixing issue :issue:`69` to allow hyphens (dashes) schema object keys
  (i.e. field names), the you should now use the :class:`~django_jsonform.utils.ErrorMap`
  helper class to construct the ``error_map`` object.

react-json-form (JavaScript)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`react-json-form <https://github.com/bhch/react-json-form>`_ has been updated
to version 2.4.0.
