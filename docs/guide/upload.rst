Uploading files
=============== 

For uploading files, use the ``string`` type along with the ``format`` keyword.

There are two ways to keep files in a JSON data:

1. **Base64 string** - the file will be encoded as Base64 string and all the data
   will be kept within the JSON object.
2. **File URL** - the file will be uploaded on the server and only the URL of the
   file will be kept in the JSON object.


Base64 string
-------------

This option is ideal for keeping small file data within a JSON object.

It is quick and easy to setup. Just by declaring the ``format`` keyword, you're
good to go.

But this convenience comes with two tradeoffs: Base64 encoded data will be 33% larger than
the original file. Second, Base64 images and files won't be cached by the
browsers unlike other images accessed via urls. For small files, these tradeoffs
shouldn't really matter.

The ``type`` should be ``string`` and ``format`` should be ``'data-url'``:

.. code-block:: python
    :emphasize-lines: 5

    # Schema
    {
        'type': 'object',
        'keys': {
            'logo': {'type': 'string', 'format': 'data-url'}
        }
    }

    # Output data
    {
        'logo': 'data:image/png;base64,<long-base64-encoded-data>'
    }



File URL
--------

This option is ideal for *"uploading"* large files in JSON data. However, it
requires a little more work to set up.

The file will be saved on the server and only a reference (such as a path or a
url) to the file is kept in the JSON data.

Features:

- :ref:`Uploading files to the server <Handling file uploads>`.
- :ref:`Listing existing files from the server <Returning a list of available files>` (Since version 2.11).
- :ref:`Deleting files <Deleting files>` (Since version 2.12).

.. tip::

    By default, the ``file-url`` field will display a button which opens a modal
    for uploading and choosing files. If you prefer a simple file input without extra
    features, see :ref:`Overriding the file input` for details.

In the schema, the ``type`` should be ``string`` and ``format`` should be
``'file-url'``:

.. code-block:: python
    :emphasize-lines: 5

    # Schema
    {
        'type': 'object',
        'keys': {
            'logo': {'type': 'string', 'format': 'file-url'}
        }
    }

    # Output data
    {
        'logo': 'path/to/logo.png'
    }


File handler view
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since uploading files or listing existing files requires interaction with the
server, you are required to create a view for handling upload and list requests.

This view will be responsible for these three things:

1. If request method is ``POST``, save files on the server.
2. If request method is ``GET``, return a list of available files for the user
   to choose from.
3. If request method is ``DELETE``, delete the file.

Before diving into details, let's look at the handler view at a basic level:

Following is a basic outline of the handler view. For working code examples,
see :ref:`Handling file uploads` section and :ref:`Returning a list of available
files` section.

.. code-block:: python 

    # Basic file handler view

    from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required

    @login_required
    def file_handler_view(request):
        if request.method == 'POST':
            # save uploaded file
            ...
        elif request.method == 'GET':
            # return available files for choosing
            ...
        elif request.method == 'DELETE':
            # delete files
            ...


Setting things up
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, create a URL for your view:

.. code-block:: python
    :emphasize-lines: 7

    # myapp/urls.py

    from django.urls import path

    urlpatterns = [
        # ...
        path('json-file-handler/', myapp.views.file_handler_view),
        # ...
    ]


You can create as many handler views as you like. For example, **one separate**
view for each JSONfield, or **one common** view for all fields.

Next, you have to tell django-jsonform which handler view to call. There are 
three ways to do that:

1. By passing the URL through :attr:`~django_jsonform.models.fields.file_handler`
   argument to the ``JSONField``;
2. Or by using the :setting:`FILE_HANDLER` setting to declare one common handler
   for all JSONFields;
3. Or by using the ``handler`` keyword in the schema to specify a separate view
   for each file input.

Option 1: Using the ``FILE_HANDLER`` setting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This option is great for declaring one common handler view for all ``JSONField``
instances.

.. code-block:: python
    :emphasize-lines: 4

    # settings.py

    DJANGO_JSONFORM = {
        'FILE_HANDLER': '/json-file-handler/'
    }


Option 2: Using the ``file_handler`` argument
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This option is great for declaring a handler for a particular ``JSONfield``. This is
especially useful if you're writing a reusable app.

This argument will override the ``FILE_HANDLER`` setting.

.. code-block:: python
    :emphasize-lines: 9, 13

    # models.py

    from django.urls import reverse_lazy

    class MyModel(...):
        data = JSONField(
            schema=...,

            file_handler='/json-file-handler/' # hard-coded URL

            # OR

            file_handler=reverse_lazy('name-of-url') # reversed URL
        )

To reverse the URL, you will have to use ``reverse_lazy`` function instead of
the regular ``reverse`` function because urls are loaded after models. Therefore,
using ``reverse`` will lead to an error.


Option 3: Using ``handler`` keyword in schema
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This option is great for declaring separate handlers for separate fields within
a schema.

This keyword will override the previous two options mentioned above.

.. code-block:: python
    :emphasize-lines: 7, 11

    # models.py

    'image': {
        'type': 'string',
        'format': 'file-url',

        'handler': '/json-file-handler/' # hard-coded URL

        # OR

        'handler': reverse_lazy('json-file-handler') # reversed URL
    }



Handling file uploads
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your file handler view will receive a ``POST`` request for uploading files.

Code example
^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this example, we'll save the file in a dedicated model called ``MediaModel``,
but you are free to save your files however you want such as directly to the
filesystem, it's up to you.

.. code-block:: python
    :emphasize-lines: 8, 15

    # views.py

    from django.http import JsonResponse
    from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required

    @login_required
    def file_handler(request):
        if request.method == 'POST':
            file = request.FILES['file']
            obj = MediaModel(file=file)
            obj.save()

            # return the path of the file
            # this value will be kept in the JSON data
            return JsonResponse({'value': obj.file.name})

        elif request.method == 'GET':
            # return available files for choosing
            ...
        elif request.method == 'DELETE':
            # delete files
            ...

Request arguments
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each ``POST`` request will also contain these additional arguments:

- ``model_name``: Name of the model.
- ``field_name``: Name of the field.
- ``coords``: :doc:`Coordinates </guide/coordinates>` of the data input field.
  (See also: :func:`~django_jsonform.utils.split_coords`)

These arguments are useful for identifying the model and the field when you have
one common handler for multiple JSON fields.

Response format
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Your view must return a ``JsonResponse`` in this format:

.. code-block:: python

    JsonResponse({'value': 'path/to/uploaded-file.jpg'})


The value of the ``value`` variable will be saved in the JSON data.


.. attention::

    It is recommended your file handler view should **return the path**
    of the uploaded file **without the media url prefix**.

    The rationale behind it is that file's url may change but file's name
    and path doesn't.

    If you're keeping the files in the ``media`` directory, the url of that file
    will look like: ``/media/path/to/image.png``.

    But if later you wish to migrate your files to a third party service such as
    AWS S3 bucket. Then the file's url will be completely different:
    ``https://s3-bucketname.amazonaws.com/path/to/image.png``.

    If you save the full url in the JSON data, then that value won't be updated
    and still have the old url.

    A better way is to just keep the path of the file and use Django's
    ``{% get_media_prefix %}`` tag in the templates to create the full url.

    See :ref:`Accessing files in templates` section below for more.


Returning a list of available files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your file handler view will receive a ``GET`` request for fetching the list of
available files.

**Here's an animated GIF of this feature:**

----

Code Example
^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the following code example we are sending files from the ``MediaModel`` we
used in the previous example:

.. code-block:: python
    :emphasize-lines: 12, 36

    # views.py

    from django.http import JsonResponse
    from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required

    @login_required
    def file_handler(request):
        if request.method == 'POST':
            # save uploaded file
            ...

        elif request.method == 'GET':
            page = int(request.GET.get('page', 1))

            files_per_page = 10

            start = (page - 1) * files_per_page
            end = start + files_per_page

            results = []

            for obj in MediaModel.objects.all()[start:end]:
                results.append({
                    'value': obj.file.name,

                    # optional data
                    # 
                    # 'thumbnail': obj.file.url,
                    # 'metadata': {
                    #     'name': obj.file.name.split('/')[-1],
                    #     'date_created': obj.created_on.strftime('%d %b, %Y'),
                    #     'size': '%s KB' % (obj.file.size / 1000),
                    # }
                })

            return JsonResponse({'results': results})

        elif request.method == 'DELETE':
            # delete files
            ...



Request arguments
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each ``GET`` request will also contain these arguments:

- ``page``: Page number. It's up to you how many items you want to show per page.
- ``model_name``: Name of the model.
- ``field_name``: Name of the field.
- ``coords``: :doc:`Coordinates </guide/coordinates>` of the data input field.
  (See also: :func:`~django_jsonform.utils.split_coords`)

Response format
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The view must return a ``JsonResponse`` in this format:

.. code-block:: python

    JsonResponse({
        'results': [
            {'value': 'path/to/file-1.jpg'}, # file 1
            {'value': 'path/to/file-2.jpg'}, # file 2
            ...
        ]
    })


Each item in the ``results`` list must be a dict containing these keys:

- ``value`` (string; **required**): The path of the file which will be saved in
  the JSON data.
- ``thumbnail`` (string; *optional*): Preview thumbnail of the file. If you don't
  provide it,
  a file icon will be displayed to the user.
- ``metadata`` (dict; *optional*): This is a dict which can contain any keys
  about the file info, such as name, size, date, etc. The ``metadata`` dict can
  contain any data you wish. All of that data will be displayed to the user under
  the file's thumbnail.

Here are some examples of the ``results`` list:

.. code-block:: python

    # 1. Items with only file names

    [
        {'value': 'path/to/file.jpg'}, # file 1
        {'value': 'path/to/file.jpg'}, # file 2
        ...
    ]

    # 2. Items with thumbnails

    [
        {'value': 'path/to/file.jpg', 'thumbnail': 'path/to/thumb.jpg',},
        ...
    ]

    # 3. Items with metadata and file info

    [
        {
            'value': 'path/to/file.jpg',
            'thumbnail': 'path/to/thubnail.jpg',
            'metadata': {
                'name': 'Name of image',
                'date': '01 Jan, 2022',
                'size': '100 KB',
            }

        },
        ...
    ]


Deleting files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 2.12


The file handler will receive ``DELETE`` requests for deleting files. It is left
up to you to delete the files. If you don't want to delete any file, you can 
just ignore all the ``DELETE`` requests.

The ``DELETE`` request are sent for the following events:

- A user clicks the *"Delete"* button on an image thumbnail.
- A user exits the page without saving the form.

Request arguments
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each ``DELETE`` request will contain these query parameters:

- ``trigger``: The event that triggered the file deletion.
- ``value``: Name of the file to be deleted. This parameter can be present more
  than once if multiple files are to be deleted. Hence, treat it like a list.
- ``model_name``: Name of the model.
- ``field_name``: Name of the field.
- ``coords``: :doc:`Coordinates </guide/coordinates>` of the data input field.
  (See also: :func:`~django_jsonform.utils.split_coords`)


**Available** ``trigger`` **values**:

========================== ===========
Trigger                    Description
========================== ===========
``delete_button``          When "Delete" button is clicked.
``unsaved_form_page_exit`` When user exits the page without saving the form.
========================== ===========

The ``trigger`` parameter helps you decide for which events you want to delete
the files and which events you want to ignore.

Response format
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Return an empty response with appropriate status code:

- ``200``, ``202``, ``204`` status codes for success.
- ``4xx`` status codes for error.

Code example
^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: python
    :emphasize-lines: 16

    # views.py

    from django.http import HttpResponse
    from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required

    @login_required
    def file_handler(request):
        if request.method == 'POST':
            # save uploaded file
            ...

        elif request.method == 'GET':
            # return list of existing files
            ...

        elif request.method == 'DELETE':
            trigger = request.GET.get('trigger')
            file_names = request.GET.getlist('value')

            if trigger != 'delete_button':
                # if deletion is not triggered by Delete button,
                # exit the view
                return HttpResponse(status=200)

            for name in file_names:
                # ... delete files ...
                ...

            return HttpResponse(status=200) # success

            # OR

            return HttpResponse(status=403) # permission denied


Accessing files in templates
----------------------------

For ``data-url``, you can just use the value as it is because all the file data
is saved in JSON as a Base64 encoded string.

For ``file url``, you may want to prepend a media url prefix using Django's
``{% get_media_prefix %}`` tag (`see Django docs <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/templates/builtins/#get-media-prefix>`_).

Suppose the data looks like this:

.. code-block:: python

    # Sample data
    data = {
        'image': 'path/to/image.png'
    }

Then in the template, you'll do something like this:

.. code-block:: django

    {% load static %}

    <img src="{% get_media_prefix %}{{ data.image }}">


Overriding the file input
-------------------------

.. versionadded:: 2.14

By default, the ``file-url`` field will display a button which opens a modal
for uploading and choosing files.

If you don't want to use those features and prefer a simple file input, you can
override that using the ``widget`` keyword:

.. code-block::
    :emphasize-lines: 4

    'logo': {
        'type': 'string',
        'format': 'file-url',
        'widget': 'fileinput' # will create a simple file input
    }
